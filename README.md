To see the project you have to take a clone and then,
1. In frontend you need to run a command 
    a. yarn install
    b. yarn start
2. In Backend you need to run a command
    a. npm install or npm i
    b. npm run dev
    
Also, for database, I used MYSQL workbench where i used to store data and connect it through the backend.[Assignment_data.csv](https://github.com/veensyadav/mernApp/files/11160084/Assignment_data.csv)
